# Feature Gating

Happier uses one canonical feature gating system. New code must use it instead of ad-hoc env checks, direct payload poking, or feature-specific inference logic.

## Canonical sources

- Feature catalog: `packages/protocol/src/features/catalog.ts`.
- Feature decision primitives: `packages/protocol/src/features/featureDecisionEngine.ts`, `packages/protocol/src/features/decision.ts`.
- Server enabled-bit helpers: `packages/protocol/src/features/serverEnabledBit.ts`.
- `/v1/features` payload schema: `packages/protocol/src/features/payload/featuresResponseSchema.ts`.

## Payload contract

- `features` is the only location for gates.
- Gates are booleans under `features.<featureId path>.enabled`.
- `capabilities` may contain configuration, details, diagnostics, or explanations, but clients must not use it as a gate.
- Treat missing or malformed server enabled bits as disabled. Call-site checks must be `readServerEnabledBit(payload, featureId) === true`, never `!== false`.

## Dependencies

- Dependencies are declared only in the protocol feature catalog.
- Enforce dependencies through `applyFeatureDependencies(...)`.
- Do not duplicate dependency logic at call sites.

## Build policy

Global allow/deny policy lives in protocol:

- `packages/protocol/src/features/buildPolicy.ts`
- `packages/protocol/src/features/embeddedFeaturePolicy.ts`

Inputs come from:

- `HAPPIER_BUILD_FEATURES_ALLOW`
- `HAPPIER_BUILD_FEATURES_DENY`
- `HAPPIER_FEATURE_POLICY_ENV`
- `HAPPIER_EMBEDDED_POLICY_ENV`

Server assembly of `/v1/features` applies build-policy denies centrally in `apps/server/sources/app/features/catalog/resolveServerFeaturePayload.ts`. Route handlers must not re-evaluate build policy ad hoc.

## Default enablement for experimental UI toggles

For features intended to be user-opt-in via UI Experimental Features toggles:

- Server-represented gates should generally default to allow so the UI can display the toggle.
- Client/UI policy should default to disabled so users explicitly opt in.
- Prefer build-policy denies for builds where a feature must be removed or hard-disabled.
- Security/compliance-sensitive features may default fail-closed on the server; document and test that exception.

## Server rules

- `/v1/features` assembly is centralized in `resolveServerFeaturePayload.ts`.
- Route gating should use `apps/server/sources/app/features/catalog/serverFeatureGate.ts`:
  - `createServerFeatureGatePreHandler(featureId)`
  - `createServerFeatureGatedRouteApp(app, featureId)`
- Do not add per-route env-only bypasses for server-represented features.

## CLI rules

- Resolve feature decisions through `apps/cli/src/features/featureDecisionService.ts` and owned helpers.
- CLI local policy belongs in `apps/cli/src/features/featureLocalPolicy.ts`.
- For server-represented features, no server snapshot is fail-closed/unknown.

## UI rules

- Resolve feature decisions through `apps/ui/sources/sync/domains/features/featureDecisionRuntime.ts`.
- Rare direct server-bit reads must use `readServerEnabledBit(snapshot.features, featureId) === true`.
- Prefer `FeatureDecision.state` over raw booleans.
- UI design/copy for feature-gated surfaces still follows UI token, text-scaling, and translation rules in `apps/ui/AGENTS.md`.

## Feature-scoped tests

Feature-scoped tests include `.feat.<featureId>.` in the filename, for example:

```text
something.feat.connectedServices.quotas.slow.e2e.test.ts
```

Vitest excludes denied feature tests using `scripts/testing/featureTestGating.ts` with dependency closure. Use `HAPPIER_TEST_FEATURES_DENY` in addition to `HAPPIER_BUILD_FEATURES_DENY` when a feature's tests must be disabled in CI without changing embedded policy.

 * Uses the canonical protocol sanitizer ([[scmWorktreeName]]) so the name we
 * store in the draft (and show on the checkout chip) matches the branch git
 * will actually create on the daemon. When the typed value normalizes to
 * nothing or contains a git-forbidden segment (a bare `@` or a `.lock` suffix —
 * which the daemon rejects rather than rewrites), we fall back to the
 * suggestion so the create flow never commits a name git would refuse.

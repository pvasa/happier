# Changelog

## Version 8 - 2026-02-18

This update includes a small navigation quality-of-life fix, improves QR scanning for terminal connect links, prevents intermittent web startup errors related to font loading, and makes the connection status menu easier to open and close.

- Fixed the sidebar logo button so it reliably returns you to the home screen.
- Fixed the connection status menu so clicking the status indicator toggles it open and closed.
- Fixed “Open Camera” so it can scan terminal connect QR codes that contain the web connect URL (not just the `happier://terminal?...` deep link).
- Fixed intermittent web font loading timeouts that could surface as “6000ms timeout exceeded” errors during startup.

## Version 7 - 2026-01-31

This release rebrands the project to Happier and updates the app/CLI identity end-to-end so installs, links, and defaults match the new name.

- Updated the app name to Happier across the UI and metadata.
- Updated the bundle identifiers and URL scheme to `dev.happier.app` / `happier://`.
- Updated the default app/web URLs to `app.happier.dev` and `api.happier.dev`.

## Version 6 - 2026-01-31

This update refreshes the app’s look and feel with a cleaner type system and a softer default background across the main UI.

- Updated the default app font to Inter for improved readability and consistency across platforms.
- Updated the app’s main background color from pure white to #F8F9FC.

## Version 5 - 2025-12-22

This release expands AI agent support and refines the voice experience, while improving markdown rendering for a better chat experience.

- We are working on adding Gemini support using ACP and hopefully fixing codex stability issues using the same approach soon! Stay tuned.
- Removed model configurations from agents. We were not able to keep up with the models so for now we are removing the configuration from the mobile app. You can still configure it through your CLIs, happier will simply use defaults.
- Elevenlabs ... is epxensive. Voice conversations will soon require a subscription after 3 free trials - we'll soon allow connecting your own ElevenLabs agent if you want to manage your own spendings.
- Improved markdown table rendering in chat - no more ASCII pipes `|--|`, actual formatted tables (layout still needs work, but much better!)
